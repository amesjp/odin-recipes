# odin-recipes
This is a simple website for recipes. It will have a home page and several pages linked that contain specific recipes. It will use basic HTML to foramt the content, and it'll probably use some paragraphs, unordered lists for ingredients, ordered lists for directions, images, and maybe some bold or italcized text for emphasis.
