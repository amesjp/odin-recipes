    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>How to make fried eggs that are really fried.</p>
    <p>Most times when frying an egg, the heat is low, there is no sizzling, and there is no texture. This recipe calls for high heat, basting the egg with oil, and results in a fried egg with crispy, lacey edges but a still runny yolk at the center.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons (45 ml) vegetable or olive oil </li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a 10-inch cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. (A small drop of water dropped into it should immediately sizzle.) Carefully break eggs into hot oil, dropping them from right above the surface to prevent hot oil from splashing. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Tilt the skillet toward you so oil pools against the side of the pan. Using a spoon, baste eggs with hot oil, aiming at the uncooked portions of the egg whites and avoiding the yolk. Continue basting until eggs are puffy and cooked, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a plate and serve.</li>
    </ol>
