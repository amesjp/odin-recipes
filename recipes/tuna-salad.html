    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tuna salad is a family favorite. This version is classic in every way, but with a couple of subtle twists to amp up its flavor and texture.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium red onion (about 8 ounces; 225 g), cut into 1/4-inch dice </li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) red wine vinegar </li>
        <li>4 (5-ounce; 140 g) cans oil-packed tuna, drained </li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) mayonnaise, plus more as needed </li>
        <li>2 stalks celery (about 6 ounces; 170 g total), cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
        <li>1 ounce (about 10 stalks) flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems, minced (about 1/4 packed cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (3 g) Asian fish sauce or very finely minced oil-packed anchovy fillets (about 2 small fillets)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>8 slices sandwich bread, very lightly toasted</li>
        <li>Romaine lettuce leaves, torn, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine onion and vinegar (vinegar should just cover onion; add more if it does not) and let stand 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine tuna and mayonnaise and mix very well with a spoon until tuna is reduced to very small shreds. </li>
        <li>Drain onion well, then add to tuna along with celery, parsley, and fish sauce or anchovy. Mix until well incorporated, then season with salt and pepper. Add more mayo, 1 tablespoon at a time, if desired. </li>
        <li>Spoon tuna salad onto 4 bread slices, top with lettuce leaves, then close sandwiches. Serve right away. </li>  
    </ol>
